use effect(() => {}) runs everytime when the state changes

use effect(() => {},[]) runs only one time, since [] is used for declaring dependencies.
currently dependency array is empty. So it will run only once

use effect (() => {}, [count]) adding a dependency, will look for
state change in count and run accordingly.


useEffect(() => {

    return () => {
        alert('Good bye component!')
    }
})
A function can be returned when the component is destroyed or
unmounted
